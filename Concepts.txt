> Whenever we used map or loop on any element must have to add unquie or id .
> unique "key" property means each item has uniquely represent .
> Whenever we used map or loop on any element must have to add unique key or id .
> Why need to add unique id ? Case : like if any restaurant container I need to add new restaurant card , react need to add card in existing cards lists with optimization but react didn't get id where to add new card So for react all cards are new so it re-renders the all cards and it is a costlier operation of DOM , that's why need to add unique key or id so card add in optimized way.
> React itself says never used index as unique key . why?{***------important------***}
> Everything whatever we can do in react is also do it by html , css , js then why react ? To make developer experience very fast and optimization web pages in backend side .
> Two type of export default export and named export 
 export default Header : default export 
 named export is used to export multiple things simultaneously add export front of variable .
 > While import named export we need to used {} like import {CDN_URL} from ...
 > While import default export we needn't to used anything like import CDN_URL from ...
