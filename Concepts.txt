> Props are like passing arguments to a function, in react props in components
> Using props we made perform dynamic data rendering 
> Config Driven UI: Controlling UI using data or config which comes from backend . Config is nothing but the data based on that the carousel varies like data is different for pune , diff for mumbai or delhi etc .{***------important------***}
> res.cloudinary is CDN for image used by SWIGGY application to store all the images there.
> map , filter , reduce usage of js is most important in react.
> resData?.info;
> (restlists.map((restaurant) => <RestaurantCard resData={restaurant}/>))
> Whenever we used map or loop on any element must have to add unquie or id .
> unique "key" property means each item has uniquely represent .
> Whenever we used map or loop on any element must have to add unique key or id .
> Why need to add unique id ? Case : like if any restaurant container I need to add new restaurant card , react need to add card in existing cards lists with optimization but react didn't get id where to add new card So for react all cards are new so it re-renders the all cards and it is a costlier operation of DOM , that's why need to add unique key or id so card add in optimized way.
> React itself says never used index as unique key . why?{***------important------***}
> Everything whatever we can do in react is also do it by html , css , js then why react ? To make developer experience very fast and optimization web pages in backend side .
> Two type of export default export and named export 
 export default Header : default export 
 named export is used to export multiple things simultaneously add export front of variable .
 > While import named export we need to used {} like import {CDN_URL} from ...
 > While import default export we needn't to used anything like import CDN_URL from ...

        -Default Export/Import 
         
         export default Components;
         import Components from "path";

         -Named Export/Import

         export const Components;
         import {Components} from "path";

> All framework, libraries are tried to solved the data and ui consistent/sync changes (Data updated but UI is not updated as per filter of data)
> Faster , optimize DOM manipulation , virtual DOM 
> Super powerful variable made by Hooks called useState , Normal JS Variable 
> Hooks is just normal js utility function that is gives to us by react which have some inbuilt property
> React Hooks 
       useState() : Super powerful state variable in react , State means maintain the state of components
       useEffect() :
> const [list ,  setList] = useState([])(default value);
> To change the state of components or value we can't change using "=" but using setList() function ;
> Whenever the state variable is update react re-renders the components;
> DOM manipulation is faster in Reactjs that's why it is faster then other framework and libraries .
